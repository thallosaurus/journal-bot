# journal-bot

## What?
This bot is a discord-based message logger that saves each message an opted user sends and can generate a whole journey entry of the day with AI

## Why?
I want to test Ollama out and want to get started with journalling but am to forgetful to actually do it. And since I am basically blasting out informations I could use myself, I want to test if I can make an automated private knowledge base

## How to get started
Coming soon
